# Training.Examine
Repository for Examine training source code
Each excercise is in a branch.  Students can work locally with each branch committing locally. If they do not finish in time then can
then jump ahead to next excercise and previous one will be completed for them.

Idea is that you would fork this repo into your account, then give read only access to delegates.  They can then download and swap branches etc.
